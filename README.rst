Wordzilla
=========

Wordzilla is a commandline based dictionary for viewing the meanings
of English words from the commandline. It can be useful for people who spend
a lot of time on the command line. It can also be integrated with your favourite
editor to view meanings of words.

The data is taken from Wikitionary and colored output is platform-dependent. Its
a port of the perl script I wrote a while back. An android version of the dictionary
is also available at `Google play store<https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.Yennaachi.Wordzilla>`
